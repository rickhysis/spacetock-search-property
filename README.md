# Spacestock Search Property Client + Google Cloud Functions Firebase Firestore

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

TL;DR:React Hooks are here, and I immediately fell in love with them. To understand why Hooks are great, I think it helps to look at how we’ve been solving a common problem.

## DEMO
Open [https://spacetock-store.firebaseapp.com](https://spacetock-store.firebaseapp.com) OR [https://spacetock-store.web.app/](https://spacetock-store.web.app) to view demo application.

### Getting Started
First, clone the repo via git:
```
$ git clone git@github.com:rickhysis/spacetock-search-property.git
$ cd spacetock-search-property
```
and then you need to run 
```
$ npm install 
OR
$ yarn 
``` 
***change default config in .env file as needed***

### Usage
Start the app in the dev environment. This starts the renderer process in hot-module-replacement mode and that sends hot updates to the renderer process:
```
$ npm run start
or
$ yarn start
```
Then open http://localhost:${PORT}/ to see your app, if it isn’t automatically opened for you.

Once you’re ready to deploy to production, create a minified bundle with npm run build. Then, you can test your minified bundle by calling npm run serve.

For more details on the available commands, see the Scripts guide on the Create React App website.
